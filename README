# libscl++
#- simple config language, smart config language, sensible config language

this library is for (de)serializing SCL (pronounced sickle) config files.
the design of SCL takes a lot of notes from TOML, however
with a lot of the fat trimmed off.

## specification

### data types
string
	a utf-8 compatable sequence of bytes
number
	a double-precision floating point type

### file layout
a SCL file is composed of one or more tables or arrays,
each of which contains a series of keys and values

a table/array definition and a key-value pair may not 
appear on the same line, however whitespace at the end or beginning of a line
does not matter.

a table is declared via the syntax:
	[table]
a table array is declared via the syntax:
	[[tableArray]]

tables may logically contain other tables, however this is done
explicitly via the use of the table naming scheme, seperated by dots.
as an example, a table "foo" containing the table "bar" is syntactically:
	[foo]
	[foo.bar]

a table definition and an array definition may not occupy the same logical name
that is to say,
	[foo]
	[bar]
	[[bar]]
	[[bar]]
is not a valid SCL file.
